<h3>Channel checking Procedure</h3>
We are checking the channels 3 times a day now to prevent major channel outages to our customers. It really looks unprofessional to have channels down for a long period, and it is even worse to have sky logo up on the TV saying we have a technical fault, or that there's issues with the subscription.
<br><br>
Im working on a way to send alarms when channels are down, but until then we need to do these regular checks. and the same applies to weekends and bank holidays.
<br><br>
So starting from this weekend, I expect an email from the tech on duty, confirming the channel check was done and what channels were down. This should be done in the morning, afternoon and evening/night. If you are on a call, delay it but dont skip it. Ill be asking you for an email to report what was down, or that all channels are up.
<br><br>
You can do this remotely from the <a href=http://newwatch.slingbox.com/>slingbox</a>(user:lazerctv@gmail.com pass:lazerx0), or if you had a call and you are close to the office or headend, do it on the TV.
<br><br>
Also check the <a href=http://cutv.lazertelecom.com/index.php?guide=1>catchup</a> (user:test pass:testx0), by checking if all channels are not grayed out as of not recording events.
<br><br>
This will for sure improve our customer experience, and we will not be waiting for them to call us to report there's an issue with our channels.
